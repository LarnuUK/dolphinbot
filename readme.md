Dolphinbot
-----

Dolphinbot was initially designed for some basic functionality (and fun) in the Fishcord Discord Server, which was created in a time when players can no longer see each other in real life to play toy soldiers. Initially it was just to provide a basic timer for round events, give random scenarios, and post the "occasional" meme (it was at first, with just "Hello there").

It grew to have a Chess Clock feature added, which allows users to "properly" time their matches, but this continues to be a work in progress.

Contributing
-----
Any contributions are welcome. I keep a list of issues for enhancements and planned features, so please comment if you would like to take on one of those specific issues.

The live version of Dolphinbot is currently running on python 3.6.9, so if you are contributing, please ensure that you are not using any syntax that is not supported in that version.

If you want to run the the script, you will first need to create yourself a Discord Server you are an Administrator of. Then create the bot in the Discord Developer portal. [Discord py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html) gives a tutorial on how to do this. Once you have created your bot in the portal, create a file `bot.key` and put *your* secret key for the bot in there. You will need to also ensure you have installed the `discordpy` module: `python3 -m pip install -U discord.py`

Raising Issues
-----

If you want to raise an issue, please double check there isn't one already in the unclosed ones. If something is broken, I will priortise these, where as enhancements and new feature requests will obviosuly get a lower one.

Implementation is also based on my ability; I am "learning" Python on the fly while doing this, so if I feel that something is beyond my ability, I will liekly close the issue (however that doesn't mean I won't come back to it).

Feel free to raise questions in the issues section as well; I will do my best to answer them when I can.
